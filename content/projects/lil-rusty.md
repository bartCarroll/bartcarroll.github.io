I created [lil-rusty](https://github.com/iambort/lil-rusty) as a side project to introduce myself to concepts in Rust. I called the repo "lil-rusty" because it had been a while since i had tried out a new language, so I was a little rusty!

## Modules

All of the below modules are written in Rust.

- **[lil-hello](https://github.com/iambort/lil-rusty/tree/master/lil-hello)** -  Basic hello world application with dockerfile for building and running.
