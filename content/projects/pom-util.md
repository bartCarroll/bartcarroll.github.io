[Pom Utility for Rust](https://github.com/iambort/pom-util) is a Rust module that can be used to read maven poms. The reason for creating this utility is I wanted to read certain attributes from maven poms without having to run a full JVM docker container.

Also, I used this as an opportunity to write integration tests in Rust.
