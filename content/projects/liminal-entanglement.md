For the Burning Man 2019 festival, our resident camp artist [Steven Doughty](https://www.stevendoughty.com/about) designed an art piece to represent different boundaries faced in life. The piece was a locked door, along with a flip-dot display terminal containing audio and visual elements. The terminal challeged users with a variety of questions to unlock the door, but much like in life, sometimes there is no right answer. 

For this project, I created the circuit designs and GPIO interactions with the Raspberry Pi, along with interfacing with the flipdot display drivers. This was a fun project as the entire system had to be run off of solar power, and had to withstand the harsh environment of the Black Rock Desert.
