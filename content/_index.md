**IAmBort** well actually my name is Bart, but people call me Bort sometimes. I'm a software engineer living in the midwest with a wide variety of hobbies in interests. The name comes from a Simpsons gag where Bart has difficutly finding a personalized license plate for his bicycle (an experience i'm very familiar with). Here you'll find some info about me, my interests, and some current and past projects.
