Howdy! I've waited long enough to start up a website again. Things have changed a
lot since my old days running Wordpress and PHPBB forums. The plan is for this
site to showcase some of the projects I'm working on, share things I find
interesting, and publish some guides that maybe someone will find useful. The majority 
of the content will probably be Software/Engineering/Art/Science focused.

For now the content will be mostly static, but I'll investigate making it more
interactive in the future.
